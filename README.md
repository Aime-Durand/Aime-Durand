## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Aime-Durand/Aime-Durand** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on the projects listed in https://roadmap.sh/frontend
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to build a website
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on easy begginer friendly projects
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with understanding the norms & culture of Github & programmers in general
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about nothing. I'm not prepared yet
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Nothing yet.
- âš¡ Fun fact: i once won an Informatic competition in Indonesia
